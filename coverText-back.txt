Greetings! And thanks for giving Tea Time Numerical Analysis a read. This textbook was born of a desire to contribute a viable, completely free, introductory numerical analysis textbook for instructors and students of mathematics. When this project began (summer 2012), there were traditionally published (very expensive hardcover) textbooks, notably the excellent Numerical Analysis by Burden and Faires, which was in its ninth edition, and is now in its tenth. As you might guess from the number of editions, this text is a classic. It is one of very few numerical analysis textbooks geared for the mathematician, not the scientist or engineer. In fact, I studied from an early edition in the mid 1990s! Also in the summer of 2012 there were a couple freely available websites, complete with video lectures. However, no resource I could find included a complete, single-pdf downloadable textbook designed for mathematics classes. To be just that has been the goal of Tea Time Numerical Analysis since its inception. A lot has happened since 2012. Publishers have made their textbooks more affordable, including e-books and rentals. More open educational resources are being produced every day and people are slowly but surely buying in. Now in its third edition, this textbook has been classroom tested and corrected; the content is typical and thoroughly covers scalar numerical analysis; and you still won't find anything else like it anywhere!
